       "\"The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century.\\n\\nHere's what happens:\\n\\n1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it consists of a broad spectrum of colors, including all the colors of the visible light.\\n2. **Light interacts with nitrogen and oxygen molecules**: The tiny molecules of nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere scatter the light in all directions.\\n3. **Shorter wavelengths are scattered more**: The smaller, shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered more than the longer, larger wavelengths (like red and orange). This is because the smaller molecules are more effective at scattering the shorter wavelengths.\\n4. **Blue light is scattered in all directions**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all parts of the sky.\\n5. **We see the sky as blue**: When we look up at the sky, we see mostly the blue light that has been scattered by the tiny molecules in the atmosphere.\\n\\nOther colors of light are not scattered as much because they have longer wavelengths and can travel through the atmosphere with less scattering. That's why the sky often appears more red or orange during sunrise and sunset, when the sun is lower in the sky and the light has to travel through more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes.\\n\\nSo, to summarize: the sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering, which scatters shorter wavelengths (like blue light) in all directions, making it visible from all parts of the sky.\""
